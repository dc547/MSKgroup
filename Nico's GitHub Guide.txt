Nico’s Guide to GitHub commands!

Perhaps there is something more ‘bulletproof’ online, but these instructions work for me (Nicos).

1.	Create an empty GitHub repository
2.	Identify repository URL 
3.	Open command prompt and navigate to the folder which you will eventually be tracking the contents of. 
4.	Copy the folder path from within file explorer
5.	In the command prompt navigate to copied folder location using ‘cd’
6.	Once in the folder path clone remote (online) repository to chosen folder: git clone URL 
a.	Check there is a .Git folder in your desired location; it may be hidden thus in file explorer go to view->options->change folder & options->view->show hidden files, folders & drives
b.	If you’re not satisfied with the location of the .git folder; cut it to the desired folder location and delete the Folder that was created (likely to be the name of the remote repository); ensure you’re still in the correct directory at command prompt.
7.	To add a folder and contents (e.g., files and folders within main folder): git add * 
a.	Adds the folder(s) within the current directory
b.	To add a single file: git add FirstFolderInRepo/SecondFolderInRepo/myFile.txt
c.	To add a single file: git add myFile.m
8.	To commit these changes: git commit -am “message”
a.	“message” something relevant for other collaborators; what have you done? What changes?
9.	Lastly, to push files from local (your computer) to remote: git push 

Useful commands:

•	To get collaborator modifications navigate to the main directory in command prompt and use: git pull 
•	To check what files you have added etc. prior to committing them you can use: git status
•	If you do not want to share a particular folders/files with collaborators put a ‘.gitignore.txt’ file in the folder which contains the .git folder
o	Will look something like this:
# Built application files
Running_implicit_muscleDriven/Polynomials/MAresults/*
*.asv
